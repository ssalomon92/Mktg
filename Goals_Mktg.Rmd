## Marketing 101

Marketing- Designing, communicating, and delivering solutions that create unique value for a set of customers and your organization.
Marketing's goal- to create more value for a group of people than the competition so that they choose us. 
Strategic marketing analysis is useful in developing a business strategy and solving business problems.

3 Key questions in marketing:

1. On which set of customers should we focus our firmâ€™s energy and resources? (Segmentation & Targeting)
2. What is our solution and why is it better? (Positioning)
3. How do we tactically do this right?

Marketing is manifested tactically by:

- Designing solutions/offerings for our target
- Communicating these solutions to our target
- Delivering these solutions to our target




### Buckley's Lessons

     alt="sample image"
     style="display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; width: 90%;
     box-shadow: 0 4px 8px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2), 0 6px 20px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.19)" />


- Have a clear goal to solve before starting solutions
- Focus on segmentation and targeting. (By reformulating Buckley's was not differentiating from competition)
- Focus on unique assets

## Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning
ML is good at predicting and finding patterns. 
There are three basic questions answered by machine learning (3x3 matrix):

1. Descriptive (Using segmentation, clustering, classification)
    - Ex1- What are the shared characteristics of customers?
    - Ex2- What customer should we focus on first?
    - Ex3- What different segments of viewers do we have?
    - Ex4- What defines these segments?
    - Great for personalization
    - Data needed- Characteristics
  
2. Predictive (Using time series analysis, random forest, neural networks)
    - Ex1- Which customers are most likely to react positively to treatment?
    - Ex2- Which customers are more likely to leave, which are more likely to renew?
    - Great for anticipation
    - Data needed- Characteristics plus Outcomes
  
3. Prescriptive (A/B testing)
    - Ex1- How can we incite customers to buy more?
    - Ex2- How can we increase likelihood that customer will buy?
    - Greate for influencing behavior
    - Data needed- Characteristics plus Outcomes plus Action/Experiments
  
Data: 

- 0 Party - Data a customer intentionally and proactively shares with a brand.
- 1st Party - Collected, owned, and managed by firm that received it. 
- 2nd Party - Data someone else collected taht they share with you.
- 3rd Party - Data collected by firms about customers for targeting or measurement. 

Watch for Selection/Sampling/Inherent biases.  
  
Idea Prioritization is useful to start tackling objectives. Rank ideas by potential value and by complexity/cost of implementation. Try to aim for ideas that are low in complexity and high in value.   


### Disney 

First find segmentation for Disney- households, male w/ no kids, females w/ kids. 
Use info to predict content, subscriptions. ML is a tactical tool that can be used effectively if done strategically and it can be misleading if used poorly. ML optimizes for what it is told.
